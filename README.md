The code you provided is a Python script that utilizes the pynput library to monitor and record keyboard events. It listens for key presses and writes the keys to a file called "demo.txt" in real-time.

Here's how the code works:

-> It imports the necessary modules, Key and Listener, from the pynput.keyboard library.
-> It initializes an empty list called k to store the pressed keys.
-> The on_press function is defined, which is called when a key is pressed. It appends the pressed key to the k list, calls the write_1 function 
   to write the keys to the file, and prints the pressed key.
-> The write_1 function takes a list of keys as input and opens the "demo.txt" file in append mode. It iterates over the keys, converts each key 
   to a string, removes the single quotes using str(i).replace("'", ''), writes the key to the file, and adds a space after each key.
-> The on_release function is defined, which is called when a key is released. If the released key is the escape key (Key.esc), it returns False 
   to stop the listener and exit the program.
-> The Listener context manager is used to create a listener object. It takes the on_press and on_release functions as arguments. The listener 
   object listens for key events and calls the appropriate functions.
-> The l.join() statement starts the listener and blocks the execution of the program until the listener is stopped.
-> To use this code, you need to have the pynput library installed. You can install it using the command pip install pynput. After running the 
   script, it will continuously monitor keyboard events and write the pressed keys to the "demo.txt" file until the escape key is pressed.
